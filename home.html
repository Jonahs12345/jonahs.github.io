        <h1>Liverpool Weekly</h1>
        <h2>Liverpool put on rampant display versus arch rivals</h2>
       <p>Liverpool beat Manchester united with a display for the ages. Thiago Alcantara was at the heart of what was surely his finest 73 minutes of football for Liverpool Football club.The trio of Luis Diaz, Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mane scored the first three goals, two of them in the first 22 minutes, in an emphatic performance to which United simply had no answerAnd Salah had the final say, set up by Diogo Jota this time, with his second of the night to cap it off as Liverpool added a four-goal win to their five-goal beating of United in October..</p> 
       <p2>The sad news that Cristiano Ronaldo would be absent following the loss of his newborn son was marked with a well-observed round of applause after seven minutes.That touching moment aside, Jurgen Klopp's side did their job ruthlessly, dismantling United in a high-tempo game - conducted expertly by Thiago - that was too much for the visitors.</p2>

<h3>Liverpool defeat bewildered Everton to leave the Toffees fighting for their life in a relegation battle</h3>
<p3>Liverpool defeated an Everton side who despite all the joy over their first half  perfomance, really didnt come to play football and they got in the end, exactly what a performance like that would deserve. At times, the Everton players showed great heart and spirit, along with a freckle of the cheating spirit, but that was never going to be enough against an in form Liverpool side who are fighting for what can only be described as a historic quadruple.</p3>

<p4>Liverpools strength eventually shown through when Divock Origi and Mo Salah linked up handomsely on the right hand side to play a lovely cross to the ever maurading Andrew Robertson, who made no mistake with his header after smashing it past the dramatic Jordan Pickford</p4>
<p5>"He is a legend on and off the pitch, that is how it is," said Jurgen Klopp when asked about Divock Origi's performance off the bench.

    "He is a fantastic footballer, for me. I know that sounds ridiculous because I don't line him up often. He is a world-class striker. He is our best finisher, he always was, and everyone would say the same.
    
    "You see these things in training and then he is not in the squad because of the quality of the other players. That is really hard.
    
    "I imagine today was the same. There are other players not in the squad who are in really good shape. Really hard decisions to make because all the boys want to contribute and all are responsible for the situations we are in.
    
    "But everyone loves Div and rightly so. He was again very decisive. I am very happy for him."</p5>
